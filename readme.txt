Blacklist IP Addresses from visiting your WordPress website and Usernames from spamming!!


== Description ==

IP Blacklist Cloud plugin allows you to blacklist IP addresses from visiting your WordPress website. Also, it submits your website link to the blocked IP database on [http://ip-finder.me](http://ip-finder.me/) which gives the other users to view how many sites have blocked the specific IP and see their comments.
New feature has been added to plugin which allows you to block usernames from spamming (comments) on your website.


Premium Service (Cloud Account) is no more available on our server. Now you can use Import / Export function.


== Installation ==

Note: Before downloading and installing plugin, you must accept that plugin sends your website url (using site_url()), website name (using get_bloginfo(‘name’)) automatically when you blacklist any IP to http://ip-finder.me and show this on relative blacklisted IP. (Example: http://ip-finder.me/wpip?IP=203.81.202.127)

SpamChecker sends comments data (Name, Email, URL and Comment) to check Spam Percentages based on our database.


1. Upload `ip_blacklist_cloud` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== How Does it Work ==

1. If you want to block an IP manually, you can do this by providing IP in admin menu “IP Blacklist->Add IP to Blacklist”.

2. If any visitor or spamming bot post comment on your posts, by visiting “Comments” menu you can view IP and details on ip-finder.me or blacklist the IP.

For example: http://ip-finder.me/wpip?IP=203.81.202.127

3. Once you black list the IP address, the visitor will not be able to view any content of your website and also post your website link and name on IP Finder cloud.

4. You can delete any IP from blacklist by visiting admin menu “IP Blacklist->Blacklist” and it will also remove your site link and name from the list of websites which have blocked that specific IP.

5. You can leave comments on IP Cloud (example: http://ip-finder.me/wpip?IP=203.81.202.127 ) so that other users can get the idea why this IP have been blocked by your site.

== Frequently asked questions ==

Q1. What data does this plugin submits to http://ip-finder.me/
Ans: * This plugin submits your WordPress site url and site name.
